# metaGPT-architect
This is a lightweight GPT helper that asks structured questions to help you design your own custom GPTs. Itâ€™s useful if you're experimenting with the GPT Builder, want more control over tone and behavior, or just like making tools that talk back in useful ways.

## What It Does

The GPT starts by asking you:
- Whatâ€™s the purpose of your GPT?
- Who is it for?
- What kind of tone should it use?
- What should it avoid doing?

It then helps you shape those answers into a system prompt you can copy into ChatGPTâ€™s custom builder.

## Why I Built This

I got frustrated trying to design GPTs that sounded right but didnâ€™t behave well.  
This tool helps clarify what you want before you start building.

I made this using only natural language + GPT-4.  
No code. No API. Just structured thinking and iteration.

## Who This Is For

- Prompt builders
- Educators
- Product designers
- Anyone exploring what GPTs can *be*, not just what they say

Built by a curious autodidact experimenting with GPT interfaces.  
Open to feedback, improvements, or forks. But be nice - I'm old and new.
